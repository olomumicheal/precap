# PROJECT RECAP

**Teaching Notes: Personal Notes App with Authentication**
*Project Recap Starting Today*

---

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this project is to build a **web application** where users can:

* Sign up and log in securely
* Create, view, edit, and delete personal notes
* Only access their own notes

This teaches fundamental concepts of authentication, CRUD operations, and basic web app architecture.

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Students Learn

1. Node.js & Express fundamentals
2. EJS templating for dynamic pages
3. CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
4. MongoDB for persistent storage
5. Authentication & Authorization using `express-session`
6. Password hashing with `bcryptjs`
7. CSS styling for clean and user-friendly interfaces

---

## 📁 Project Setup Steps

Follow these steps **before deployment** to get your project running locally:

### Step 1: Initialize Project Folder

* Create a project folder and initialize it with `npm init`
* Set up your folder structure with `config`, `models`, `routes`, `views`, and `public/css`

---

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

* Install necessary packages using npm:

  * **Express** for the server
  * **EJS** for templating dynamic HTML
  * **Mongoose** for connecting to MongoDB
  * **express-session** for session management
  * **bcryptjs** for password hashing
  * **connect-mongo** to persist sessions in MongoDB
  * **dotenv** to manage environment variables
  * **method-override** to support PUT and DELETE methods
  * **nodemon** for auto-reload during development

---

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

* Create a `.env` file to store sensitive information:

  * `PORT` → The port your app will run on (e.g., 3000)
  * `MONGO_URI` → Your MongoDB connection string
  * `SESSION_SECRET` → A random string used to secure sessions

---

### Step 4: Database Connection

* Use Mongoose to connect to MongoDB in a `db.js` file inside the `config` folder
* Ensure your database is accessible and running

---

### Step 5: Server Setup

* Set up your Express server in `server.js`
* Include middleware for sessions, parsing request bodies, serving static files, and method override
* Connect routes for user authentication (`/users`) and notes management (`/`)

---

### Step 6: Models

* Create `User` model for user accounts (name, email, password)
* Create `Note` model for notes (title, content, user reference)
* Use pre-save hooks in the `User` model to hash passwords automatically

---

### Step 7: Routes

* **User Routes** (`/users`):

  * Signup
  * Login
  * Logout

* **Notes Routes** (`/`):

  * Dashboard showing user notes
  * Create Note
  * Edit Note
  * Delete Note

* Ensure only authenticated users can access note routes

---

### Step 8: Views

* Use EJS to render dynamic HTML pages:

  * `index.ejs` → Dashboard (shows notes)
  * `login.ejs` → Login page
  * `signup.ejs` → Sign up page
  * `createNote.ejs` → Add new note
  * `editNote.ejs` → Edit existing note
  * `partials/header.ejs` & `footer.ejs` → Reusable layout components

---

### Step 9: Styling

* Add CSS in `public/css/style.css`
* Focus on a clean, user-friendly interface with readable forms, buttons, and notes layout

---

### Step 10: Running Locally

1. Make sure your MongoDB server is running
2. Run the app with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`

* You should see the login page
* After signing up or logging in, you’ll be redirected to the dashboard

---

## 🚀 Deployment on Render

Render is a **cloud platform** for hosting web applications. Follow these steps to deploy your app:

### Step 1: Push Project to GitHub

* Make sure your project is committed to a GitHub repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for deployment"
git push origin main
```

---

### Step 2: Create a Render Account

1. Go to [Render](https://render.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click **New → Web Service**

---

### Step 3: Connect Repository

1. Choose **Connect GitHub**
2. Select your project repository
3. Name your web service

---

### Step 4: Configure Service

* **Environment**: Node
* **Build Command**: `npm install`
* **Start Command**: `npm start`

---

### Step 5: Add Environment Variables

* In Render dashboard → your service → **Environment** → Add variables:

  * `MONGO_URI` → Your MongoDB connection string
  * `SESSION_SECRET` → Random string
  * `PORT` → Leave blank (Render sets this automatically)

---

### Step 6: Deploy

1. Click **Deploy**
2. Render will install dependencies, build your app, and start it
3. Your app will be available at `https://<your-service-name>.onrender.com`

---

### Step 7: Verify

* Visit the URL provided by Render
* Test: Sign up, log in, create, edit, and delete notes
* Check logs in Render dashboard if something doesn’t work

---

### ✅ Tips for Smooth Deployment

* Make sure all dependencies are in `package.json`
* Keep `.env` secrets only in Render environment variables, never push them to GitHub
* Use MongoDB Atlas for a reliable remote database connection
